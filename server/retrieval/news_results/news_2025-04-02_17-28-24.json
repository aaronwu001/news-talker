            "description": "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is set to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. The hearing comes as the plane maker has faced manufacturing and safety crises in its commercial and defense units. Ortberg has said the company’s turned a corner in improving its manufacturing processes.Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg on Wednesday will outline to Congress the company’s progress on improving its manufacturing and safety standards after years of crises in both its commercial and defense units, including a 2024 near-catastrophic midair door plug blowout on one of its planes that left Boeing’s factory without key bolts installed.“Boeing has made serious missteps in recent years — and it is unacceptable. In response, we have made sweeping changes to the people, processes, and overall structure of our company,” Ortberg said in written testimony, which was seen by CNBC ahead of the Senate Commerce Committee hearing. “While there is still work ahead of us, these profound changes are underpinned by the deep commitment from all of us to the safety of our products and services.” United Airlines adds Thailand, Vietnam and Australia flights in latest expansionGoodbye to ‘bags fly free’ on Southwest, the last free perk in AmericaFirst-class seats are getting so fancy they’re holding up new airplanesU.S. consumers are starting to crack as tariffs add to inflation, recession concernsOrtberg and other Boeing executives have outlined improvements across the manufacturer’s production lines in recent months, as well as wins like a contract worth more than $20 billion to build the United States’ next generation fighter jet. But lawmakers and regulators have maintained heightened scrutiny on the company, a top U.S. exporter.“Boeing has been a great American manufacturer and all of us should want to see it thrive,” Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the committee, said in a statement in February announcing the hearing. “Given Boeing’s past missteps and problems, the flying public deserves to hear what changes are being made to rehabilitate the company’s tarnished reputation.”The Federal Aviation Administration last year capped Boeing’s production of its 737 Max planes at 38 a month following the January 2024 door plug blowout. The agency plans to keep that limit in place, though Boeing is producing below that level.Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said at a Senate hearing last week that the agency’s oversight of the company “extends to ongoing monitoring of Boeing’s manufacturing practices, maintenance procedures, and software updates.”Correction: Chris Rocheleau is acting FAA administrator.

            "description": "Many student loan borrowers are experiencing challenges on their timeline to debt forgiveness. Here’s what they can do to stay on track for the relief.Leopatrizi | E+ | Getty ImagesAubrey Bertram was starting to imagine her life without student debt.Bertram, a staff attorney at Wild Montana, a nonprofit that works on land conservation in the state, had just around two and a half years left of payments before her $247,804 federal student loan balance would be excused under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.But for many months now, she’s been frozen on her timeline to that relief.“We’re not getting credit,” said Bertram, 35. “This time has been devastating.”Bertram took out her loans in law school knowing that she’d work in public service and pursue PSLF.“That was the only way taking on this debt made any sense,” Bertram said.Millions of other student loan holders are in the same frustrating limbo now. After Republican-led legal challenges blocked the Biden administration’s new repayment plan in the summer of 2024, the borrowers who enrolled in the program, like Bertram, have found themselves stuck.Many of those borrowers remain in a forbearance that doesn’t bring them closer to debt forgiveness, while the Trump administration recently revised other student loan repayment plans to no longer conclude in debt cancellation.Here’s what to know about the current challenges to federal student loan forgiveness, and what you can do about them.SAVE borrowers are stalled on way to forgivenessKent Nishimura | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesD’Aungilique Jackson, of Fresno, California, holds a “Cancel Student Debt” sign outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., after the nation’s high court struck down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief program on Friday, June 30, 2023.Many federal student loan borrowers who enrolled in the Biden administration-era SAVE, or Saving on a Valuable Education, plan remain in a forbearance as a result of GOP-led legal challenges to the program. But unlike the Covid-era pause on student loan bills, this forbearance does not give borrowers credit toward debt forgiveness under an income-driven repayment plan or Public Service Loan Forgiveness.A recent U.S. appeals court decision blocked SAVE, as well as the loan forgiveness component under other income-driven repayment plans.Historically, at least, IDR plans limit borrowers’ monthly payments to a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. PSLF, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, allows certain not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans wiped away after 10 years of payments.“In the end, we may see borrowers lose over a year of monthly payments to count toward forgiveness,” said Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors, which helps students navigate college costs and borrowing.If you’re eager to be back on your way to debt cancellation, you have options, experts say.You may be able switch out of the now-blocked SAVE plan and into another income-driven repayment plan. The Education Department recently re-opened several IDR plan applications, following a period during which the plans were unavailable. (The Trump administration said it was updating the plans’ applications to make them comply with the recent court order over SAVE.)The IDR plans open now, according to the Trump administration, are: Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment.“The caveat on ICR and PAYE is that automatic forgiveness after 20 or 25 years is not available now since the courts have questioned that permissibility under statute,” said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, a trade group for federal student loan servicers.Still, if a borrower enrolled in ICR or PAYE, then switches to IBR, their previous payments made under the other plans will count toward loan forgiveness under IBR, as long as they meet the plan’s other requirements, Buchanan said.Meanwhile, borrowers in any of the three IDR plans can get credit toward PSLF.Those who want to be making progress toward debt cancellation should see which plan comes with a monthly payment they can afford. There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different options.For now, Bertram has decided to stay put in the SAVE forbearance, even though she’s not moving any closer to debt forgiveness. She’s worried she’ll switch into a new repayment plan only to find that program has also been halted or amended.“You’re constantly being jerked around by political rhetoric,” Bertram said. “I just hope I’m student-debt free before I’m 40.”",

            "description": "Republican senators are meeting Wednesday morning with President Donald Trump at the White House as they push ahead on his big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts while delaying some of the most difficult decisions, including the costs and how to pay for the multitrillion-dollar package.The Senate GOP’s budget framework would be the companion to the House Republicans’ $4.5 trillion tax cuts package that also calls for cutting some $2 trillion from health care and other programs. If the Senate can move the blueprint forward, it would edge Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill closer to a compromise setting the stage for a final product in the coming weeks.“Obviously we are hopeful this week we can get a budget resolution on the floor that will unlock the process,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. “And so we are continuing to move forward with that.”Trump Administration6 hours agoLive updates: President Trump set to announce new round of tariffsFood & DrinkMar 15Where Trump's tariffs will hit your grocery list, from avocados to frozen fishThune and Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee are meeting with Trump before the expected public release of their budget blueprint by the committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as soon as the afternoon. While big differences remain, Republicans face increasing political pressure to deliver on what is expected to be Trump’s signature domestic policy package: extending the tax cuts, which were initially approved in 2017, during his first term at the White House. Those tax breaks expire at the end of the year, and Trump wants to expand them to include new no taxes on tipped wages, overtime pay and other earnings, as he promised during the 2024 campaign.Democrats are preparing to oppose the GOP tax plans as giveaways to the wealthy, coming as billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is taking a “chain saw” to the federal government. They warn Republicans plan to cut government programs and services that millions of Americans depend on nationwide.“We are standing together against the GOP tax scam and in defense of the American people,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said alongside others on the Capitol steps late Tuesday.One main sticking point between the House and Senate GOP plans has been over whether the existing tax cuts, which are estimated to cost the federal government $4.5 trillion over the decade in lost revenue, need to be paid for by spending reductions elsewhere. Adding Trump’s new tax breaks to the package would balloon the price tag.To offset the costs, House Republicans are demanding some $2 trillion in cuts to health care and other accounts to stem federal deficits and prevent the nation’s $36 trillion debt load from skyrocketing.But GOP senators have a different approach. They take the view that because the tax cuts are already the current policy, they would not be new and would not need to be paid for. They want to use this current policy baseline moving forward, meaning only Trump’s other proposed tax breaks would come with a new cost. They are expected to set much lower spending cuts as a floor that can be raised, if needed, to compromise with the House’s $2 trillion in cuts.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and top Democrats call the Senate GOP’s approach a gimmick at best, if not an outright “lie.”“It is an obscene fraud and the American people won’t stand for it,” said Schumer, Sen. Jeff Merkley of the Budget Committee and Sen. Ron Wyden of the Finance Committee in a letter to GOP leadership.Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey argued against the GOP baseline as “a gimmick” that would cut important federal services while growing deficits. “What they’re investing in is bigger tax cuts for the wealthiest,” Booker said during a landmark overnight speech. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and congressional GOP leaders have been meeting privately as Trump’s priority package churns on Capitol Hill. At a meeting with other Senate Republicans late Monday at the Capitol, Bessent urged them to get it done.Typically, the current policy baseline proposal would need to pass the muster of the Senate’s nonpartisan parliamentarian to make sure it abides by the strict rules of the budget process. Senators from both parties have been arguing in closed-door sessions with the parliamentarian staff — for and against the idea. But GOP leaders say they don’t necessarily need the Senate parliamentarian, at this point, to resolve the issue, and they believe Graham, as the Senate Budget Committee chairman, has the authority to allow their current policy baseline approach. What is more certain is that they want to move quickly this week to pass the framework. That will entail a lengthy all-night vote that could drag into the weekend. Then, they will sort out the details later as the Republicans, facing Democratic opposition, build the actual package for consideration in the weeks, if not months, ahead.",

            "description": "Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is set to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET. The hearing comes as the plane maker has faced manufacturing and safety crises in its commercial and defense units. Ortberg has said the company’s turned a corner in improving its manufacturing processes.Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg on Wednesday will outline to Congress the company’s progress on improving its manufacturing and safety standards after years of crises in both its commercial and defense units, including a 2024 near-catastrophic midair door plug blowout on one of its planes that left Boeing’s factory without key bolts installed.“Boeing has made serious missteps in recent years — and it is unacceptable. In response, we have made sweeping changes to the people, processes, and overall structure of our company,” Ortberg said in written testimony, which was seen by CNBC ahead of the Senate Commerce Committee hearing. “While there is still work ahead of us, these profound changes are underpinned by the deep commitment from all of us to the safety of our products and services.” United Airlines adds Thailand, Vietnam and Australia flights in latest expansionGoodbye to ‘bags fly free’ on Southwest, the last free perk in AmericaFirst-class seats are getting so fancy they’re holding up new airplanesU.S. consumers are starting to crack as tariffs add to inflation, recession concernsOrtberg and other Boeing executives have outlined improvements across the manufacturer’s production lines in recent months, as well as wins like a contract worth more than $20 billion to build the United States’ next generation fighter jet. But lawmakers and regulators have maintained heightened scrutiny on the company, a top U.S. exporter.“Boeing has been a great American manufacturer and all of us should want to see it thrive,” Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the committee, said in a statement in February announcing the hearing. “Given Boeing’s past missteps and problems, the flying public deserves to hear what changes are being made to rehabilitate the company’s tarnished reputation.”The Federal Aviation Administration last year capped Boeing’s production of its 737 Max planes at 38 a month following the January 2024 door plug blowout. The agency plans to keep that limit in place, though Boeing is producing below that level.Acting FAA Administrator Chris Rocheleau said at a Senate hearing last week that the agency’s oversight of the company “extends to ongoing monitoring of Boeing’s manufacturing practices, maintenance procedures, and software updates.”Correction: Chris Rocheleau is acting FAA administrator.

            "description": "We all want people to take us seriously. But so many of us, in trying to earn that respect from others, say things that we think will make us sound smart — only to fall on our faces.As psychologist Paul Penn put it, “Trying to sound clever is a good way of sounding stupid.” But there’s a way around this. As language and communication experts, we’ve come across some simple and effective strategies that actually work.1. Be intentional about your word choiceBehavioral studies have found that theoretically “smart” language winds up turning people off instead of impressing them. You want to sound natural and not clinical.So while it’s tempting to want to dazzle people with complicated or multisyllabic words, you’re better off sticking with simpler choices.DON’T MISS: How to successfully change careers and be happier at workFor example, use “begin” instead of “commence,” “method” instead of “methodology,” “use” instead of “utilize,” and “help” or “assist” instead of “facilitate.” 2. Don’t try to be someone you’re notAdding new words or phrases to your vocabulary just to sound more intelligent for a specific situation is a bad idea. If it’s not natural to you, it comes off as artificial and unconvincing.Also, make sure that you know what a word means before you use it. For example, people often use the word “simplistic” thinking it’s a more upscale way of saying “simple.” But it isn’t. It has a completely different, and negative, meaning. When you describe something as simplistic, you’re saying that someone took a complex concept and oversimplified it. In effect, they dumbed it down. So if you call someone’s idea simplistic, it’s not a compliment at all.3. Use an active voiceYou might think you are adding a flourish to your speech by using complicated sentence structures in the passive voice, but it only alienates people. So opt for active phrases.For example, instead of saying: “Sales have continued to maintain their upward trajectory in the current quarter,” say, “Sales increased this quarter.”4. Get straight to the pointBe clear about your topic. Focus on what you’re trying to get across and make it easy for others to really understand your points. Research shows that when people can easily understand what you’re talking about and can process it without trouble, they tend to think of you as more capable and intelligent.5. When possible, say it, don’t write itWe often think that the written word can make us seem more intelligent than the spoken. After all, there are no “ums” or other filler words when you write, and you can choose more complicated ways of expressing yourself.But that’s not the case. People often react more positively to someone’s voice and assess the speaker as smarter.6. Steer clear of jargonManagers repeatedly say that overuse of jargon is an immediate turn-off. In many cases, it can be the difference between landing that job or not or getting that promotion you want or not.Along these lines, it’s a good idea to avoid throwing in popular but tired jargon words like “leverage,” “synergy,” “transformative” and the like. They’re vague, they’re cliched, and they’re usually unnecessary. 7. Say nothingThat’s right. Staying silent for a few seconds can make people think of you as smart. Studies have found that if you pause between words while you’re speaking, people often think you’re more articulate and educated. That break in your speech when there’s no punctuation reason for it, like a period, is technically called an “unfilled pause,” but we like to call it “smart silence.”Kathy and Ross Petras are the brother-and-sister co-authors of the New York Times bestseller You’re Saying It Wrong, along with other popular language books, and co-hosts of the award-winning NPR syndicated radio show and podcast “You’re Saying It Wrong.” They’ve also been featured in media outlets including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post and Harvard Business Review.
