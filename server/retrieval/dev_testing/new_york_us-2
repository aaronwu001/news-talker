            "description": "Why give Apple $300 for their iPad battery-draining Magic Keyboard when you can get a Doqo Blade that not only looks exactly like the Magic Keyboard, but does everything, exactly like the Apple alternative and uses Bluetooth 5.3 and equipped with the fastest, no-lag chip on the planet, has it's own power source so it doesn't depend and drain the iPad battery like the Magic Keyboard does, and costs $230 less than the Apple version (with 20% off coupon) Sorry Apple, I love all your stuff, but I'm not paying $300 for a keyboard. This keyboard is amazing guys. I just got mine today in the mail and I am beyond impressed. It's not heavy at all. The iPad sticks to the magnet like it was born with it. Very strong. Very steady. Theyboard itself lights up (RGB backlighting) and can be turned off at will. Since the keyboard has its own internal rechargeable battery, it doesn't depend on the iPad for power like Apple's Magic Keyboard does, therefore you iPad battery will last longer. The glass trackpad is extremely responsive just like the Apple variant and the typing experience is simply amazing. I highly recommend it. Below is a link to the company product and a link to a review video of it. PRODUCT LINK: https://www.doqo.shop/products/doqo-blade-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11-inch REVIEW VIDEO:",
